# N-SPC

## What is this?

This is the original source code to `KAN.ASM` (more known as N-SPC), version `S1.20`.

`KAN.ASM` is the standard sound driver supplied to SNES third parties. This version only includes
support for music sequences, apparently it was expected that the game developer would add their own
sound effect code on top.

For a list of games that use it, see [here](http://gdri.smspower.org/wiki/index.php/Super_Famicom/Super_NES_Sound_Driver_List#N-SPC.2FKankichi_.28Nintendo.2F.22Y.K.22.29).

This code is provided for reference only. No music or sample data is provided. While the code has been
slightly modified to build with ca65, it's not guaranteed that it will work.
